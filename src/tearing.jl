# Functions to tear systems of equations

# Details are described in the paper:
#   Otter, Elmqvist (2017): Transformation of Differential Algebraic Array Equations to
#                           Index One Form. Modelica'2017 Conference.
#
# The following utility algorithm is used below to incrementally added edges to a
# DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). This algorithm leads to an O(n*m) worst time complexity of the
# tearing (instead of O(m*m)) where n is the number of equations and m is the number of
# variable incidences. Note, the traversals of the DAG are not performed with recursive function
# calls but with while loops and an explicit stack, in order to avoid function stack overflow
# for large algebraic loops.

#
#   Text excerpt from this paper (the advantage of Algorithm N is that it
#   is simple to implement and needs no sophisticated data structures)
#
#       3. A ONE-WAY-SEARCH ALGORITHM FOR DENSE GRAPHS
#           [..]
#       To develop the algorithm, we begin with a simple algorithm and then modify it to
#       improve its running time. We call the simple algorithm Algorithm N (for “naive”). The
#       algorithm initializes k(v) = 1 for each vertex v. The initial vertex levels are a weak
#       topological numbering since the initial graph contains no arcs. To add an arc (v,w),
#       if k(v) < k(w), merely add the arc. If, on the other hand, k(v) ≥ k(w), add the arc and
#       then do a selective forward search that begins by traversing (v,w) and continues until
#       the search traverses an arc into v (there is a cycle) or there are no more candidate
#       arcs to traverse. To traverse an arc (x, y), if y = v, stop (there is a cycle); otherwise, if
#       k(x) ≥ k(y), increase k(y) to k(x)+1 and add all arcs (y, z) to the set of candidate arcs to
#       traverse.
#       It is easy to show that (1) after each arc addition that does not form a cycle
#       the vertex levels are a weak topological numbering, (2) Algorithm N is correct, and
#       (3) 1 ≤ k(v) ≤ size(v) ≤ n for all v. Since an arc (x, y) notEqual (v,w) is only traversed as a
#       result of k(x) increasing, each arc is traversed at most n times, resulting in a total time
#       bound of O(nm) for all arc additions.
